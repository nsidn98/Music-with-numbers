# Music-with-numbers
Give any number to this code and it will convert it into music.<br/>
For example the first 'n' digits of pi can be converted to music.<br/>

## Requirements:
`pysynth`<br/>
To install [download from this site](https://mdoege.github.io/PySynth/#u)

## Notation:
The first number defines the note.<br/>
The next number defines the duration of that note.<br/>

* Thanks YourMJK for the image(screenshot).
## Scales Explanation:
A scale is a dict which contains keys for each of the digits.`c3`,`d#`,etc. are musical notes. The second part in the dict is the duration of that note.Lower the number longer is the duration.


## Usage:
Change the `number` in the script(your wish :p).<br/>
Choose the `scale` which may be one of the given ones or you own scale.<br/>
Give a name to the file and then run the function `create_wav`


* Will be glad to know if some scale creates a nice music!
